# Water-potability-prediction
##A water potability prediction model uses machine learning algorithms to determine whether water is safe for human consumption1
. These models analyze various physical and chemical properties of water, such as pH levels, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and the presence of contaminants like fecal coliform1
. By training on historical data, the model can predict potability with high accuracy, helping ensure safe drinking water1
